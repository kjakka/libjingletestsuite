1. Test Suite Description
The Test Suite was developed to collect Libjingle file transfer protocol data, verify correctness, and show a performance comparison between PseudoTCP and JQTCP under various network conditions.

2. Setup

Hardware:
Machine #1, a router - requires two network interfaces and NIST net. For more information on NIST net see, <http://www-x.antd.nist.gov/nistnet/>. IP Table configuration scripts are included with the source code.
Machine #2, a sender - requires one network interface and Visual Studio 2005.
Machine #3, a receiver - requires one network interface and Visual Studio 2005.

Configuration Files:
'Control' - This directory stores the results, scenarios, schedules, and test files for the sender and receiver.

(The TestFile location on the sender side does is required to be in the same directory as the binary)

Third party components:
- QuickHash must be added, see <http://www.slavasoft.com/quickhash/index.htm>.

- An MDD compiled version of the libjingle library is required to be added under 'Common', see <http://code.google.com/apis/talk/libjingle/index.html>.
